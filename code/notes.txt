4. Vairations of GP:
	- kernel: depends on characterization of lightcurves
	- maximum likelihood optimization
	- no. of data points to predict on - every 2 days
5. ML?

------------------------------------------------
1. nan 
4. warnings for infinite z. Can I just check for denominator ==0?

1. Increase decrease levels?
2. Slow increases? Need them
3. Continuous increase?

-------------------------------------------------------

Paper 1:
4. 3 params manipulation
6. look up MAD normalization
7. Reread paper
8. lookup confusions markes on overleaf

Paper 2. TBD
1. Location of nearest object in PS1? Also vs. Location in ZTF ref?
2. Negative subtractions?
3. Star galaxy score? Atleast its interpretation?
4. Magnitude of nearest obj in ZTF ref and its relation with sgscore?
5. Self gravitation
6. TDE Rate det. using obs and theory,  TDE LF, TDE MF, Loss Cone, blah 
7. Watch video
8. Read answers
9. Flux limited samples
10. g-r mean, m_g - m_r < 1, rate
11. point spread function

--------------------------------------------------

Choices made:
    individual predictions for each band

Can be added:

half peak to peak
    From paper 1:
        Thiel sen estimation
        Candidate flares using Thiel sen
        Characterization of candidate flares: median/peak amplitude over meadian level, tspan, npts
        MAD of the flare amplitudes (peak amplitude OR median amplitude) (?)
        normalization with MAD (?)
        Weibull fit 
        At least 300 days, peak at least 1 mag above thiel sen, min 30 npts

    From paper 2:
        m_peak in both bands OR m_peak-baseline
        at least 5 nights of postpeak multi band photometry (?)
        post peak g-r color change rate (?)
        post peak g-r color mean (?) - day of peak, include errors
        e-fold times for rise and decline
    
    Misc:
        Combine filters to increase confidence
        Include errors in calcraw
        Flare specific calcraw

TODOs:
    Add the params to the code
    Error propogation for g-r and calcraw

    Play around detector T, and fluxdiffs

TODAY
1. Finish up code
    - UI for tuning flare finder: mode: DONE 
    - flux peaks for each flare: make variables
    - half peak to peak: DONE: plot?
    - peak to half peak: DONE: plot?
    - g-r mean at peak
    - g-r rate of change

2. Statistics
    - more reading about exponential filters
