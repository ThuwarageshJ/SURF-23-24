4. Vairations of GP:
	- kernel: depends on characterization of lightcurves
	- maximum likelihood optimization
	- no. of data points to predict on - every 2 days
5. ML?
------------------------------------------------
1. nan 
4. warnings for infinite z. Can I just check for denominator ==0?

1. Increase decrease levels?
2. Slow increases? Need them
3. Continuous increase?
-------------------------------------------------------

Paper 1:
4. 3 params manipulation
6. look up MAD normalization
7. Reread paper
8. lookup confusions markes on overleaf

Paper 2. TBD
1. Location of nearest object in PS1? Also vs. Location in ZTF ref?
2. Negative subtractions?
3. Star galaxy score? Atleast its interpretation?
4. Magnitude of nearest obj in ZTF ref and its relation with sgscore?
5. Self gravitation
6. TDE Rate det. using obs and theory,  TDE LF, TDE MF, Loss Cone, blah 
7. Watch video
8. Read answers
9. Flux limited samples
10. g-r mean, m_g - m_r < 1, rate
11. point spread function

Choices made:
    individual predictions for each band

Flare parameters:

    From paper 1:

        ADDED TO CODE:
            Thiel sen estimation 
        NOT:
            Candidate flares using Thiel sen
            Characterization of candidate flares: median/peak amplitude over meadian level, tspan, npts
            MAD of the flare amplitudes (peak amplitude OR median amplitude) (?)
            normalization with MAD (?)
            Weibull fit 
            At least 300 days, peak at least 1 mag above thiel sen, min 30 npts

    From paper 2:

        ADDED TO CODE:
            m_peak in both bands OR m_peak-baseline
            post peak g-r color change rate (?)
            post peak g-r color mean (?) - day of peak, include errors
        NOT:
            at least 5 nights of postpeak multi band photometry (?)
            e-fold times for rise and decline 
    
    Misc:

        ADDED TO CODE:
            Half peak to peak time
            Peak to half peak time
        NOT:
            GP fit params 

TODOs:

    DOABLES:

        Combine filters to increase confidence
        Include errors in calcraw - DONE
        More rigorous calcraw function
        Flare-specific OR population-specific calcraw params
        Make Flare class?

1. SDSS query gen
2. PANSTARRS-1
3. Add code for Zp


1. More work for exp filter
2. Backup plans
3. Abstract and interim reports

Code cleanup

Customize Flaredetector
Multi processing

------------------------------------------------------------

input problem for simulations
suggestion:
- begin with raw files
- make lc,  do zp corrections
- simulate from lc
- run it through the code

Power law (t0)

beginning time for secondary flare, plateau

T0

Randomizations:
    t peak
    peak flux ref 
    T0?
    t first light (for power law)
    n, p (powerlaw)
    t0 (power law)
    t decay
    t plateau
    secondary flare variables (same)


How to vary (random or fixed uniformly distributed values?)
How many simulations per sample?
Choosing flat curves
ZP correction + joining fields --> simulate --> Test
Final report
