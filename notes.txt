4. Vairations of GP:
	- kernel: depends on characterization of lightcurves
	- maximum likelihood optimization
	- no. of data points to predict on - every 2 days
5. ML?

------------------------------------------------
1. nan 
4. warnings for infinite z. Can I just check for denominator ==0?

1. Increase decrease levels?
2. Slow increases? Need them
3. Continuous increase?

-------------------------------------------------------

Paper 1:
4. 3 params manipulation
6. look up MAD normalization
7. Reread paper
8. lookup confusions markes on overleaf

Paper 2. TBD
1. Location of nearest object in PS1? Also vs. Location in ZTF ref?
2. Negative subtractions?
3. Star galaxy score? Atleast its interpretation?
4. Magnitude of nearest obj in ZTF ref and its relation with sgscore?
5. Self gravitation
6. TDE Rate det. using obs and theory,  TDE LF, TDE MF, Loss Cone, blah 
7. Watch video
8. Read answers
9. Flux limited samples
10. g-r mean, m_g - m_r < 1, rate
11. point spread function

--------------------------------------------------

Choices made:
    individual predictions for each band

Can be added:
    Insp. from paper 1:
        Thiel sen estimation
        Candidate flares using Thiel sen
        Characterization of candidate flares: median/peak amplitude over meadian level, tspan, npts
        MAD of the flare amplitudes (peak amplitude OR median amplitude) (?)
        normalization with MAD (?)
        Weibull fit 
        At least 300 days, peak at least 1 mag above thiel sen, min 30 npts

    Insp. from paper 2:
        m_peak in both bands OR m_peak-baseline
        at least 5 nights of postpeak multi band photometry (?)
        post peak g-r color change rate (?)
        post peak g-r color mean (?)
        e-fold times for rise and decline
    
    My:
        Combine filters to increase confidence
        Include errors in calcraw
        Flare specific calcraw

TODOs:
    Add the params to the coding
    Watch TDE video

    Read answers - questions remain 
    Paper doubts

    Organize Git repo
    Pickle
    Latex - paper summaryss
    Remove outliers

    Make LCs sorted
